## How to get CYB?

There are 3 ways to get tokens that allow you to participate in testnet either as a validator or as an search agent:

1. **Get it for free**. 1 million Ethereum addresses has been included in genesis block of cyber protocol based on the ranking defined in paper. You can verify how many tokens has been allocated to your address [downloading web3 browser Cyb](https://cyb.ai) and searching for `genesis` there. Our roadmap has several distribution events before genesis of mainnet so we probably expand a ways to drop tokens in the future.

2. **Buy OTC**. There is a way to buy CBD tokens from other web3 agents. Go to https://t.me/cybotc group and try to find somebody who sell you some tokens.

3. **Earn through coding**. Go to Gitcoin and [finish some bounty](https://gitcoin.co/profile/cybercongress). For every finished bounty we have a 1B CYB prize as well as CBD prize.

It is for purpose that acquiring tokens in testnetwork is hard. Participation in testnet requere some skills from agents. So early participation make sense only for experienced users.

## How to get CBD?

CBD is an [ERC-20 proto token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x136c1121f21c29415D8cd71F8Bb140C7fF187033) that serves a purpose to make CYB distribution more reliable and convinient for investors and developers of the cyber protocol. Based on CBD balances CYB balances are computed every new testnetwork according to allocation in roadmap. It is much more easier to get CBD than CYB becouse they can be traded on any Ethereum DEX easily. The drawback of CBD is that you need to wait the next phase of development in order to actually use some part of CBD value in testnetwork either as validator or as an agent. There will be several way to buy CBD tokens.

1. **Buy OTC**. Go to https://t.me/cybotc group and try to find somebody who sell you some SBD tokens.

2. **Buy on Forkdelta**. Go to https://forkdelta.app/#!/trade/0x136c1121f21c29415D8cd71F8Bb140C7fF187033-ETH. May be somebody sells some CBD there?

3. **Contribute to community**. You can wait a bit until cyberFoundation formation event. You will be able to get some CBD for the ETH donation. All ETH donated during formation event will become the ownership of DAO managed by contributors.
